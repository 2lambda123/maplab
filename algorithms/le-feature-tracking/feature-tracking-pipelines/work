- Integrate into Milans Codebase


- Impl BRISK detector
- Gyro predictions

- Implement RANSAC visualization


- Fix outlier tracks return
 Returning of outlier tracks does not work anymore.
      // Earlier we set the TrackId to -1 but now we delete it, so the indices
      // change....
      

===
      
- Tune rejectin mask radius
- Rejection: Appearance-based outlier rejection. 





Optional:
- Refactor to combine the detector & descriptor in one class offering the 
  the following interfaces (internally cache pyramids):
     - Compute orientations/scale
     - Detect (subpixel)
     - ComputeDescriptors & Orientation (what about scale?)
   ==> mainly to remove the orientation feature which is not provided by many  
- Consider removing hasNonDescribableFeatures feature as the detector should
  make sure this is the case 
    --> one more strong point to combine detector & descriptor
- Parallelize the frame loop
- Inegrate visualization into flow. 
- LK-tracker: re-calculate orientation, scale, score

Cleanup:
  - Export common functionality (flows) from ROVIOLI (e.g. HAL-flows for datasrouce, etc.)
  - Use the FeatureTrackingGyroAided in ROVIOL
